# BallsNSpokes
This Java application is an animated optical illusion that you can customize.  It animates a set of balls that slide along the radial lines of a single circle.  The radius of each ball fluctuates as a sinusoidal function.  The balls have identical frequencies and amplitudes, but each one is offset from the previous by a small phase shift, creating the illusion of a wave rolling around the edge of a circle.  

User options include the number of balls, the frequency of the oscillations and the minimum and maximum radius of each oscillation.  You can also show/hide red tracer balls to create additional visual effects.

Depending on the settings you choose, your can fool your eye into seeing a rigid spinning object, or a pulsating blob that is not rotating.  Must be seen to be believed!
