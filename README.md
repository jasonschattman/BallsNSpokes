# BallsNSpokes
This Java application is an animated optical illusion that you can customize.  It animates a set of balls that slide along the spokes of a wheel.  Each ball oscillates along its spoke as a sine function.  The balls have identical frequencies and amplitudes, but each ball is offset from the previous by a small phase shift, creating the illusion of a wave rolling around the edge of the wheel.  

User options include the number of balls, the frequency of the oscillations and the minimum and maximum radius of each oscillation.  You can also show/hide red tracer balls to create additional visual effects.

Depending on the settings you choose, your can fool your eye into seeing a rigid spinning object, or a pulsating blob that is not rotating.  Must be seen to be believed!
